# Guide to Making Cold Process Soap

Cold process soap making is a traditional method involving the careful combination of oils and sodium hydroxide (lye). Below is a guide covering key terms, safety practices, and essential equipment to help you get started.

## Key Terms in Cold Process Soap Making

- **Trace**: Trace is the stage at which the oils and lye mixture (lye water) are fully blended. At a thin trace, the mixture has a uniform consistency similar to that of a thin cake batter, with no visible oil streaks. Over time, the soap will thicken, progressing to medium and thick trace.
  
- **Gel Phase**: During the gel phase, the soap heats up to around 82°C (180°F) and takes on a glossy, gel-like appearance. This phase typically occurs during the saponification process.

- **Curing**: Although cold process soap is technically usable after just a few days, it's recommended to allow a curing period of 4-6 weeks in a dry, cool space with good airflow. Curing helps excess water evaporate, resulting in firmer bars that are milder and last longer when used.

- **Lye Calculator**: A lye calculator is an essential tool for creating your soap recipes accurately. Simply input the weight or percentage of your oils, and the calculator provides the exact amount of lye and liquid needed. It also calculates the superfat percentage, which represents the amount of excess oil in the recipe. You can find a useful calculator [here](https://www.brambleberry.com/calculator).

- **Soda Ash**: Soda ash is a white, ashy film that can appear on the surface of your soap. It's caused when unsaponified lye comes in contact with carbon dioxide in the air. While it doesn't affect the soap’s quality or safety, it can obscure detailed designs or give a crumbly feel. To reduce soda ash, consider using a 10% water discount or inducing the gel phase.

## Lye Safety Guidelines

Lye is a caustic and highly reactive substance, so proper handling is vital for safe soap making. Always work in a well-ventilated area free of children, pets, or any distractions. Here’s a list of safety gear you’ll need:

- **Gloves**: Protect your hands with rubber gloves that reach up to your elbows. Thinner nitrile or latex gloves offer good protection without being cumbersome.
  
- **Goggles**: Since lye can cause severe eye damage, it's important to wear goggles that offer side protection. If you wear glasses, ensure that your goggles fit over them comfortably.

- **Long Sleeves, Pants, and Closed-Toe Shoes**: Wear clothing that covers your skin completely to guard against accidental splashes.

- **Face Mask (Optional)**: If you're sensitive to lye fumes or working with large batches, consider wearing a dust mask.

## Essential Soap Making Equipment

When selecting equipment for soap making, set aside tools that will only be used for this purpose, as lye and fragrances can linger in small crevices even after cleaning. Avoid using the dishwasher for cleaning soap-making tools; handwashing is recommended.

- **Containers**: Use heat-resistant bowls made from glass, plastic, or stainless steel. Avoid aluminum as it can react with lye and produce harmful fumes.

- **Stick Blender**: To save time and achieve proper blending, a stick blender is highly recommended. Whisks or stand mixers can take hours to achieve the desired consistency, whereas a stick blender can emulsify your soap in just a couple of minutes.

- **Silicone Spatulas and Spoons**: These tools are great for scraping every last bit of soap from your container and smoothing or texturing the top of your bars.

- **Scale**: A scale is crucial for accurate measurements since soap recipes are generally measured by weight, not volume.

- **Molds**: Choosing the right mold depends on your preferences and recipe:
  - **Silicone Molds**: Easy to use, clean, and unmold, making them perfect for both beginners and advanced soap makers.
  - **Wooden Molds**: Ideal for making large batches and promoting the gel phase. Be sure to line these molds with freezer paper or a silicone liner.
  - **Plastic Molds**: Suitable for cold process soap but may require additional steps. To ensure easy release, use recipes with a higher content of hard oils and consider adding sodium lactate.
