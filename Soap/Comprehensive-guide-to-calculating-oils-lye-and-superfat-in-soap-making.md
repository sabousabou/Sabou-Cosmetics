### **Soap Making: Selecting Oils, Determining Percentages, and Calculating Superfat**

Soap making requires careful consideration of the oils you select, the percentages of each oil in the recipe, and the superfat level to ensure the final product is balanced and effective. This guide will walk you through the process of selecting oils, calculating the required amounts of each oil, and adjusting for superfat in cold process soap making.

### **Step-by-Step Process for Selecting Oils and Calculating Superfat**

#### 1. **Decide on the Total Batch Size**
- Determine how much oil you want to use in the recipe. For example, if you're making a 1,000g batch of oils, all the calculations will be based on this total.

#### 2. **Choose Your Oils and Their Percentages**
Each oil contributes different properties to the final soap, such as hardness, lather, or conditioning. Choose your oils based on the qualities you want in your soap.

Example for a 1,000g batch:
- **Palm Oil (hardness, stable lather)**: 55% = 550g
- **Rice Bran Oil (conditioning)**: 25% = 250g
- **Coconut Oil (cleansing, bubbly lather)**: 15% = 150g
- **Sweet Almond Oil (conditioning)**: 5% = 50g

#### 3. **Calculate the Required Lye (NaOH)**
Each oil has a **Saponification Value (SAP)**, which tells you how much lye (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) is needed to convert 1 gram of the oil into soap.

Example SAP values:
- **Palm Oil**: 0.141
- **Rice Bran Oil**: 0.128
- **Coconut Oil**: 0.178
- **Almond Oil**: 0.136

Multiply the weight of each oil by its SAP value to find the amount of lye needed for that oil.

**Calculations**:
- **Palm Oil**: 550g × 0.141 = 77.55g of NaOH
- **Rice Bran Oil**: 250g × 0.128 = 32g of NaOH
- **Coconut Oil**: 150g × 0.178 = 26.7g of NaOH
- **Almond Oil**: 50g × 0.136 = 6.8g of NaOH

**Total NaOH required**: 77.55g + 32g + 26.7g + 6.8g = 143.05g of NaOH

#### 4. **Calculate Lye with Superfat**
Superfatting is the process of adding extra oils to ensure the soap is moisturizing. To calculate lye with superfat, reduce the total lye by the desired superfat percentage (commonly 5%).

Formula:
\[
\text{Lye with superfat} = \text{Total NaOH} \times \left( 1 - \frac{\text{Superfat percentage}}{100} \right)
\]

For a 5% superfat:
\[
\text{Lye with superfat} = 143.05g \times 0.95 = 135.9g of NaOH
\]

#### 5. **Calculate the Water**
Water is used to dissolve the lye. You can calculate the amount of water based on:
- A **lye-to-water ratio** (commonly 2:1 or 2.5:1 water to lye).

For a 2.5:1 water-to-lye ratio:
\[
\text{Water} = 135.9g \times 2.5 = 339.75g of water
\]

Alternatively, you can use a percentage of the oil weight (typically 30-38% of total oil weight).

#### 6. **Final Recipe**
After calculating all values, here is the final recipe for a 1,000g batch with 5% superfat:
- **Total Oils**: 1,000g
- **Superfat**: 5%
- **Lye (NaOH)**: 135.9g
- **Water**: 339.75g

### **Selecting Oils: Properties and Percentages**

Choosing the right oils is crucial for creating a balanced soap. Below is a summary of common oils and their characteristics.

#### **Common Soapmaking Oils and Their Properties**

| Oil Type          | SAP (NaOH) | Common Usage % | Properties                                   |
|-------------------|------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Coconut Oil**    | 0.178      | 10-30%         | Hard, bubbly lather, cleansing                |
| **Olive Oil**      | 0.135      | 30-60%         | Conditioning, moisturizing, gentle lather     |
| **Palm Oil**       | 0.141      | 20-50%         | Hardness, stable lather                      |
| **Rice Bran Oil**  | 0.128      | 15-25%         | Conditioning, stable lather                  |
| **Almond Oil**     | 0.136      | 5-10%          | Moisturizing, conditioning                   |
| **Shea Butter**    | 0.128      | 5-15%          | Creamy, moisturizing, luxurious texture      |
| **Castor Oil**     | 0.129      | 3-5%           | Bubbly lather, conditioning                  |

#### **General Guidelines for Oil Percentages**
- **Hardness** (Coconut, Palm, Shea Butter): 30-60%
- **Conditioning** (Olive, Almond, Rice Bran): 30-60%
- **Cleansing** (Coconut, Palm Kernel): 10-30%
- **Lather (Bubbly)** (Coconut, Castor): 3-5%
- **Creaminess** (Shea Butter, Cocoa Butter): 5-15%

### **Adjusting the Recipe for Different Superfat Percentages**

The superfat percentage determines the amount of unsaponified oils left in the soap, affecting how moisturizing it is. Common superfat ranges:
- **5% Superfat**: Standard for most skin types.
- **7-10% Superfat**: Good for sensitive or dry skin, results in more moisturizing but slightly softer soap.
- **1-3% Superfat**: Firmer, more cleansing soap.
